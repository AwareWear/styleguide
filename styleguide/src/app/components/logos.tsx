        <p>The AwareWear logo takes the shape of a clothing tag, with a vibrant green leaf cradled at its center, reflecting our commitment to the environment. It&apos;s set against a backdrop reminiscent of natural paper, enhancing its organic appeal. &apos;AwareWear&apos; is written in bold letters, underscoring our focus on sustainable fashion education. A rustic border encases the logo, marrying structure with the essence of nature. The logo comes in three variants: full color on the left, displaying the leaf in its lush green; a grayscale version in the middle, for understated elegance; and a stark black and white version on the right, for classic simplicity. Each version represents our fusion of style, learning, and eco-awareness.</p>

        <p>
        AwareWear features six badge logos, each splashed with one of our signature colors. The font was deliberately chosen due to how the letters W nests into the A. These badges aren&apos;t just prettyâ€” they&apos;re a key part of our app&apos;s look and feel. More than that, they&apos;re on brand with sustainable fashion. They use our brands colours to fit seamlessly with our application. The leaf within the logo is representative of sustainability and the subtitle speaks to educating our users to rethink they&apos;re fashion decisions.
